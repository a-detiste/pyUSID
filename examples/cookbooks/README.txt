Guides to pyUSID
--------------------
* The documents below should be sufficient for you to learn how to use and even write code for pyUSID.
* If you haven't already, please go through the external tutorials on python, scientific data analysis in python, etc.
* All the documents listed below will assume that you understand the **Universal Spectroscopy and Imaging Data (USID)** model. Please read that document before beginning

To learn how to use pyUSID, go through the following documents in the recommended order:

1. Primer to h5py
2. The USIDataset
3. Data translation and the NumpyTranslator
4. Plot utilities (not necessary to learn pyUSID but we have several functions you are likely to find handy)
5. Utilities to read USID HDF5 files (a.k.a. **h5USID** files)
6. Data type manipulation utilities
7. Parallel computation

To learn how to write to h5USID files, write data processing classes, or adding functionality to pyUSID, go through these additional documents in the recommended order:

8. Utilities that assist in writing data
9. Utilities to write h5USID files
10. Formalizing Data Processing
11. Input / Output / Computing utilities
